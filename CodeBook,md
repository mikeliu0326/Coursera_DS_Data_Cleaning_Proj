## Code Book
## Data:
X_test: test data for wearable tech, directly read in from X_test.txt
X_train: training data for wearable tech, directly read in from X_train.txt
feature_names: column names for X's, directly read in from features.txt

sub_test: test subject numbers, directly read in from subject_test.txt
sub_train: training subject numbers, directly read in from subject_train.txt

y_test: test labels, directly read in from y_test.txt
y_train: training labels, directly read in from y_train.txt
activity_labels: table mapping labels to their activity text

## Variables:
X_total: merged version of X_test and X_train after feature names were applied
         later subsetted using extract_ind
extract_ind: indicies of the columns of X_total which include mean or std
sub_total: merged sub_test and sub_train, label set to "subject"
y_total: merged version of y_test and y_train, with label numbers mapped to their text using activity_labels

merged_data: merged version of sub_total, y_total, X_total
merged_tidy: melted version of merged_data, melted on columns subject and activity such that the variable column corresponds to the feature names from X, and the values column is its associated value
merged_tidy_avgs: aggregated version of merged_tidy, mean of any values sharing the same subject, activity, and variable (feature from X)

## Transformations:
cbind: used to combine datasets by column (ie X, y, sub)
rbind: used to combine datasets by row (ie train and test)
melt: used to transform a dataset into a stacked/tidy version of itself
aggregate: used to apply an aggregate function to any values in a dataset that satisfy a specified condition
